1. In the statement below, does A get the value of X, or does X get the 
value of A?
X=A;
X gets the value of A.

2. If there are switches on port B and LEDs on port D, give the commands to:
a.) Read from the switches on port B and write them to port D.
PORTD = PINB;

b.) Copy the value of the most for significant bits on the switches on
port B to the 4 most significant bits of port D without changing the value
of port D's lower 4 bits.

char temp = PINB & 0xf0;
temp |= PIND & 0x0f;
PORTD = temp;

3. What value in binary should PORTB have assigned to it to display ambeer
LEDs?
PORTB = 0xc0;

4. In your own words decribe the meaning of the term 'persistence of vision'.
Persistence of vision refers to the length of time an image stays in our
vision.  Like a camera, our eyes have a sort of exposure period - if a beam of
light crosses our vision quickly enough, we see a streak of light instead of
an individual dot.  This effect can be used to display an image over an area
without every point being illuminated at the same time.  For example, on our
Wunderboards, we can only illuminate one row at a time.  So, to display an
image on the whole 8x8 grid, we must cycle through the rows (going over each
row at least 10 times per second), and our eyes will store the image long
enough for us to process what is being displayed.
