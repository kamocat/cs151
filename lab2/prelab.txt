Lab 1 study questions:
1.
pwd - Present Working Directory.  This tells me where I am on the computer (what folder the command prompt is currently in)

cd - Change Directory. this command changes my present working directory.  I can go "up" one level by using the command "cd ..", or I can go to an absolute path using "cd /foo/bar/foo_bar"

rm - removes a file.  This is how I delete something.

cp - copies a file or folder. 

mkdir - creates a new folder.

rmdir - deltes a folder.

ls - lists files and folders in the current directory.

PRELAB:

To determine if an integer is even or odd, I would modulus it by 2.

Example:
char is_it_odd(int x) {
	return (x%2);
}
