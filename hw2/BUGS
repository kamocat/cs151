AllStat produces a segfault
FIXED: was trying to dereference a pointer without allocating space


getl produces a segfault
FIXED: the search now ignores the first_name if its pointer is NULL
or if the first character is '\0'.

stat produces many "errors" when run in valgrind
I think this is from using a function inside the parethesis of an if()
instead of using a variable there.


FIXED: was trying to stitch elements to NULL (when list was empty)
Seg fault after second person is entered.
(perhaps related to the search function)


FIXED: Switched to same text interpeter as used for reading gradebook files
Doesn't accept the assignment input
(At least, it reports that the input isn't correct.
Since it uses fgets, this should mean that it isn't processing
the input.  If it were using scanf, then we would have to worry
about it reading multiple strings from the same line.


FIXED: now handles the search properly, including if the item should go at
the beginning or end of the list.  First and last names are no longer 
switched.  However, it does not yet turn all to lower case.


FIXED: Adding and importing work properly.
The issue with interpet_line was that I was trying to delete newline twice. 
I fixed this by making a function to cut off a string at the first newline 
(excluding the newline), which catches itself if there is no newline.
