This file describes current bugs in the program.
It does not give dates or people or importance - date and person can be
deduced by the looking at the git history, and the importance is described
in the description


FIXED: was trying to stitch elements to NULL
Seg fault after second person is entered.
(perhaps related to the search function)


FIXED: Switched to same text interpeter as used for reading gradebook files
Doesn't accept the assignment input
(At least, it reports that the input isn't correct.
Since it uses fgets, this should mean that it isn't processing
the input.  If it were using scanf, then we would have to worry
about it reading multiple strings from the same line.


Search isn't returning correctly
It now doesn't cause a memory leak, but I still think it's not returning
the correct location.  First and last names are being switched somewhere
during the add student process.
