 * This is a description of how the gradebook will work.
 * Each function is described in the comments, with pseudocode,
 * and the function prototype is immidiately below.
 * I wrote out rough sketches on paper, but by the time I was ready to
 * type it up, I though it made more sense in many cases to write it
 * as *ALMOST* code.
 *
 * The exception is mean, median, and std_dev, whose functions are
 * written as regular c code.
