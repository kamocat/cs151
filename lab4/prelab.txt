1.
In the C language, = is an assigment operator.  The statement
x = 5;
	means that x is now equal to 5.  On the contrary,
x == 5;
	tests if x is currently equal to 5 (without assigning it)
and returns TRUE if they are equal.  (This is the sort of statement
that would be used in the test clause of an if statement).



2.  Explain in words what the following C code does:
if ( q == 9 ) {
	q = q - 1;
} else {
	q = q + 1;
}
