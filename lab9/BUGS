A bugs file for lab9

Does not display code sequence on screen.
(I can display it live, but it is cleared when the pause has elapsed)
FIXED: Had disabled one of the catches to make it only display once.
Also had to disable the live display.  I might re-enable the live display once I
have it displaying characters.

Dit and Dah display the same color
FIXED: was not resetting beep, so once a dah was entered, every subsequent
entry was a dah.
